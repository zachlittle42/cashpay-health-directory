# VitalityScout - User Experience Gap Analysis

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-28
**Purpose:** Identify friction points in the end-user journey and prioritize UX improvements

---

## Executive Summary

VitalityScout has **strong content foundation** (190 pages, 25 guides, 114K words) and **clear business strategy**, but lacks **user-centric features** that convert information into action.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **Content Strength:** Comprehensive guides, provider listings, destination info
- ❌ **Decision Tools:** No cost calculators, filters, or comparison features
- ❌ **Personalization:** No accounts, saved searches, or location-based results
- ❌ **Trust Signals:** Limited reviews, testimonials, or booking confirmation
- ❌ **Navigation:** No site search across 190 pages

### Impact
Users can **learn** about options but struggle to **decide** and **take action**. This creates:
- High bounce rates (users get overwhelmed and leave)
- Low conversion rates (no clear path from browsing → booking)
- Competitive disadvantage (MDsave, NewChoiceHealth have better filtering/booking)

3. No value prop above the fold ("Save 50-80% on healthcare")

---

### Stage 2: EXPLORATION (Users browse options)

**User Actions:**

4. **No follow-up:** Users don't get support through booking process

---

### Stage 6: POST-CONVERSION (After booking)
