## Regulatory Considerations for Content

### FDA/FTC Guidance for US-Based Publishers

**What we CAN do:**
- Publish educational content about what treatments exist
- Describe what clinics offer without endorsing efficacy
- Provide pricing and logistics information
- Include balanced information about risks and lack of FDA approval

**What we CANNOT do:**
- Make efficacy claims ("stem cells cure arthritis")
- Use testimonials as proof of effectiveness
- Omit FDA non-approval status
- Hide affiliate relationships

**Required Disclaimers:**
1. "These treatments are not FDA-approved in the United States"
2. "This information is educational only, not medical advice"
3. "Consult with your physician before pursuing any treatment"
4. "Efficacy and safety have not been established in controlled clinical trials"

**Sample Disclaimer Block:**
```
This guide is for educational and informational purposes only. The treatments
described are legal in [Country] under [Regulatory Body] oversight but are NOT
approved by the US FDA for the conditions discussed. The FDA has issued warnings
about unproven stem cell and regenerative treatments. Consult with your physician
before pursuing any treatment abroad. We do not endorse or guarantee the efficacy

## Notes for Content Creation

1. **Always lead with educational value** - What is this treatment? How does it work? Who is it for?

2. **Be honest about the science** - Many treatments are promising but unproven. Say so.

3. **Include safety information** - Risks, side effects, what can go wrong.

4. **Practical logistics matter** - Costs, travel, recovery time, number of visits.

5. **Avoid hype** - No "miracle cure" language. Let readers draw their own conclusions.

6. **Disclaimers are not optional** - Every guide needs proper medical and regulatory disclaimers.

7. **Update regularly** - This field moves fast. Date everything.
