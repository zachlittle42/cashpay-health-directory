# CashPay Health Directory - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

CashPay Health Directory is a healthcare marketplace connecting consumers with transparent, affordable healthcare options—both cash-pay and insurance-based. The platform currently covers 36 providers across 9 categories including telehealth services (labs, GLP-1, TRT), local services (DEXA scans), and medical tourism (dental, hair transplants, bariatric, plastic surgery, fertility).

**The Vision:** Become the definitive resource for Americans seeking affordable healthcare by providing price transparency, provider comparison, and eventually personalized cost estimates based on individual insurance plans.

---

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem

1. **Healthcare costs are opaque:** 73% of Americans cannot estimate their out-of-pocket costs before receiving care
2. **Insurance doesn't mean affordable:** 70% of MDsave users have insurance but still seek cash-pay options to stretch deductible dollars
3. **Fragmented information:** Consumers must visit 10+ websites to compare options across telehealth, local, and medical tourism
4. **No unified cash+insurance view:** No platform currently shows both cash-pay AND insurance negotiated rates in one place

### Market Size

| Segment | Market Size | Growth Rate |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Direct Primary Care | $70B (2025) → $93B (2029) | 7.3% CAGR |
| Digital Health Startups | $10.1B funded (2024) | AI-enabled 37% of funding |
| Medical Tourism (US outbound) | $40B+ annually | 15-20% CAGR |
| Prescription Savings (GoodRx model) | $792M revenue (2024) | 6% YoY |

### Regulatory Tailwinds

- **Hospital Price Transparency Rule (2021):** Hospitals must publish negotiated rates
- **No Surprises Act (2022):** Protects patients from surprise billing
- **Health Plan Price Transparency (2024):** Insurers must publish machine-readable pricing files
- **Result:** Trilliant Health now tracks 2,659 hospitals + 3,491 ASCs across 50 states with 50M commercial lives

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Company | Model | Strengths | Weaknesses | Funding |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **MDsave** | Bundled procedure marketplace | 5,000 providers, 2,000 procedures, 30 specialties, employer solutions | Hospital/ASC focused only, no telehealth, $5-12K/mo provider fees | $45M+ |
| **NewChoiceHealth** | Price comparison directory | 17,000 facilities, free API, 400 procedures | Estimates only, no booking, no telehealth | Unknown |
| **GoodRx** | Prescription discount coupons | Massive scale, pharmacy partnerships, brand recognition | Rx only, no procedures, facing CVS/Walmart competition | Public ($3B market cap) |
| **Turquoise Health** | B2B price transparency data/API | 160+ customers, comprehensive hospital data, AI contract tools | B2B only, no consumer-facing | $55M |
| **Serif Health** | B2B price transparency API | 300+ company customers, real-time search | B2B only, no consumer-facing | YC-backed |

### Adjacent Players

| Company | Focus | Relevance |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Medibid** | Auction-based care marketplace | Similar cash-pay focus, competitive bidding model |
| **Savvos** | Alternative payor marketplace | Connects health shares, self-funded employers |
| **FAIR Health** | Non-profit pricing database | 52B claims, consumer education focus |
| **Clear Health Costs** | Price transparency journalism | Real pricing data, crowdsourced |

### What's Missing in the Market

1. **No unified platform** covers telehealth + local + medical tourism + insurance pricing
2. **No editorial layer** with "Our Take," pros/cons, and curated recommendations
3. **No state-by-state healthcare guides** with local system rankings
4. **No personalized insurance integration** for true out-of-pocket estimates
5. **No affiliate model** that aligns incentives with patient outcomes

---

## Unique Differentiators (Your Competitive Moat)

### 1. **The "Wirecutter for Healthcare" Model**
Unlike MDsave (transactional) or NewChoiceHealth (data-only), provide:
- Editorial "Our Take" opinions on every provider
- Curated "Best For" recommendations (e.g., "Best for first-time users," "Best for athletes")
- Honest pros/cons comparisons
- **Why this matters:** Trust. Healthcare is personal—people want recommendations, not just data.

### 2. **Unified Cash + Insurance Pricing (Someday Vision)**
Build toward showing:
- Cash-pay price
- Average insurance negotiated rate (via Turquoise/Serif APIs)
- Personalized out-of-pocket estimate when user connects insurance
- **Why this matters:** GoodRx does this for prescriptions. No one does it for procedures.

### 3. **Three Delivery Models in One Place**
Only platform covering:
- **Telehealth** (national, no travel): Labs, GLP-1, TRT
- **Local** (in-person, your city): DEXA, IV therapy, longevity clinics
- **Medical Tourism** (destination care): 40-90% savings on major procedures
- **Why this matters:** Competitors are siloed. You're the one-stop shop.

### 4. **State-by-State Healthcare Guides**
Create comprehensive guides for each state:
- Top 3-5 health systems with pricing data
- Best ambulatory surgery centers (Newsweek ranks 650 nationally)
- Regional telehealth options
- Medical tourism accessibility (border state advantages)
- **Why this matters:** Local SEO goldmine. "Best surgery centers in Texas" has buying intent.

### 5. **Transparent Affiliate Model with Alignment**
Unlike MDsave's $5-12K/mo provider fees:
- Free basic listing for all providers
- Revenue from affiliate commissions on referrals
- Featured placements for premium partners
- **Why this matters:** No provider fees = more comprehensive directory. Affiliate model = only earn when you help someone.

### 6. **Community + Reviews Layer (Future)**
Build what healthcare lacks:
- Verified patient reviews post-procedure
- Community forums for medical tourism experiences
- Price reporting (crowdsourced pricing data)
- **Why this matters:** Creates network effects and defensible content.

## Revenue Model Evolution

### Phase 1: Affiliate Revenue (Now → Year 1)
- Telehealth affiliate links (5-15% of first purchase/subscription)
- Medical tourism referral fees ($100-500 per patient)

### Phase 3: Premium Features (Year 1 → Year 3)
- Insurance integration tool (freemium → paid)

- Employer/HR dashboard for benefits teams
- **Target:** $100K+ MRR

### Phase 4: Data/API Products (Year 2+)

- **Target:** Enterprise contracts $50-200K/year

---

## Someday Vision: The North Star

### The Ultimate Product (3-5 Years Out)

**"Enter your insurance, get your price."**

1. User enters procedure (e.g., "MRI knee")
2. Platform shows:
   - Cash-pay options nearby with exact prices
   - Their specific insurance out-of-pocket cost at each facility
   - Medical tourism option with total cost including travel
   - Telehealth alternatives if applicable
3. User can book directly or request a quote
4. Post-procedure, user leaves verified review

### Why This is Possible Now

- **CMS Marketplace API:** Live health plan data
- **Price Transparency Files:** Insurers must publish rates (Turquoise/Serif are parsing)
- **Definitive Healthcare Data:** 9,000+ ASCs with pricing
- **Your Foundation:** Already have provider database, category taxonomy, editorial framework

### What It Takes to Get There

1. **API Integration:** Partner with Turquoise or Serif for negotiated rate data
2. **Insurance Verification:** Build/integrate eligibility checking
3. **Facility Database:** Expand from 36 providers to 5,000+ facilities
4. **User Accounts:** Enable saved insurance info and personalization
