## 🧭 Current Reality (June 2026)

The site has grown well beyond the 2024 snapshot below. Verified footprint:

- **51 long-form guides** under `/guides`
- **3 programmatic local clinic-directory verticals** — `hormone-therapy`, `weight-loss`,
  `dexa-scans` — each wired for **14 states** with city-level pages (e.g. 258 hormone
  clinics in TX alone). Pattern lives in `src/data/*-clinics-*.ts` + `*-clinics-index.ts`.
- **Medical tourism**: 147 providers across 14 destinations + deep guide/cost coverage
- **Telehealth money pages**: `labs`, `glp1`, `trt` (+18 providers)
- **Traditional healthcare**: 50 states + California regional/health-system deep dive
- **Longevity / stem cells**: hub + US regions + intl stem-cell directories
- **Healthcare resources**: insurance (13), pharma (13), drug registry (10)
- **Infra**: auto-discovering sitemap (no dead URLs), JSON-LD across pages, `llms.txt`/AEO

### Active Expansion Mandate
Broaden coverage to **all primary cash-pay services** across three pillars:
(1) in-person medical care, (2) in-person wellness & aesthetic services, (3) e-commerce
telehealth / personal products for health, wellness, longevity, and performance.

**Agreed build sequence:**
1. ✅ **Longevity & Performance e-commerce** — *shipped* (`/longevity-performance` hub +
   `/cgm`, `/longevity-rx`, `/peptides`, `/supplements`, `/recovery-tech`). Data in
   `src/lib/performance-products.ts`; rendered by the generic `CompareCategoryPage`.
2. ✅ **DTC telehealth money pages** — *shipped* (`/mens-health` (ED & hair), `/skincare`,
   `/womens-health` (menopause/HRT), `/mental-health` (therapy & psychiatry)). Data in
   `src/lib/telehealth-dtc.ts`; integrated into the `/telehealth` hub. Both pillars share
   `src/components/CompareCategoryPage.tsx` (section-aware) via thin adapters.
3. ⏭️ **Med-spa & aesthetics directory** — Botox, fillers, laser, microneedling, body
   contouring + IV therapy (state×city, reuses the clinic-directory engine; fills empty `iv`).
4. ⏭️ **Fill empty clinical categories** — `vo2max`, `longevity` providers, `orthopedic`,
   `cardiac`, `vision` (currently render thin "coming soon" pages — SEO risk).

### Known SEO Gaps / Tech Debt
- Empty taxonomy categories (`vo2max`, `iv`, `longevity` providers, `orthopedic`, `cardiac`,
  `vision`) ship as thin "coming soon" pages — fill or `noindex`.
- `CONTENT_OVERVIEW.md` page/word counts are stale (still say 190 pages).

## 💰 Money Pages vs Supporting Pages

Understanding which pages drive revenue vs. which pages build authority is critical for prioritization.

### Money Pages (Conversion-Focused)
These pages are designed to convert visitors into revenue through affiliate clicks, lead gen, or referrals.

| Page Type | URLs | Monetization Method |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| **Telehealth comparisons** | `/labs`, `/glp1`, `/trt` | Affiliate links to providers (Hims, Ro, Everlywell, etc.) |
| **Individual provider pages** | `/providers/[slug]` | Direct CTA → affiliate conversion |
| **Local clinic categories** | `/dexa`, `/vo2max`, `/iv`, `/longevity` | Lead gen, booking referrals |
| **Medical tourism procedures** | `/dental`, `/hair_transplant`, `/bariatric`, `/plastic_surgery`, `/fertility` | Clinic referral fees, lead gen |
| **Destination + procedure** | `/destinations/mexico`, `/destinations/turkey` | High-intent users → clinic CTAs |

**Characteristics of Money Pages:**
- Comparison tables with clear CTAs
- "Best for" recommendations
- Pricing information
- Direct links to providers/clinics
- Users have purchase/booking intent

### Supporting Pages (Authority & Traffic)
These pages build topical authority, rank for informational keywords, and funnel users to money pages.

| Page Type | URLs | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Guides** | `/guides/glp1-weight-loss-complete-guide`, etc. | Rank for "how to" queries → link to money pages |
| **FAQs** | `/faq`, `/faq/glp1`, `/faq/medical-tourism` | Answer questions → build trust → internal links |
| **Traditional healthcare** | `/traditional-healthcare/[state]` | Local SEO traffic, authority building |
| **Health system pages** | `/health-systems/[slug]`, `/california/health-systems/[slug]` | Informational, no direct monetization yet |
| **Hub pages** | `/telehealth`, `/local-clinics`, `/medical-tourism` | Navigation/discovery → route to money pages |

**Characteristics of Supporting Pages:**
- Educational/informational content
- Internal links to money pages
- Build E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)
- Target top-of-funnel keywords
- May include soft CTAs to money pages

### Current Monetization Gaps

| Section | Status | Opportunity |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Telehealth | ✅ Ready | Apply to affiliate programs, add tracking |
| Local Clinics | 🔴 Empty | Build out providers, then monetize |
| Medical Tourism | 🟡 Partial | Add lead capture, clinic partnerships |
| Traditional Healthcare | 🔴 No monetization | Add cash-pay alternative CTAs, Centurion spotlight |

### Internal Linking Strategy
Supporting pages should always link to relevant money pages:
- Guides → Category comparison pages
- FAQs → Relevant provider pages
- Traditional healthcare → Cash-pay alternatives (telehealth, local clinics)
- All pages → Centurion spotlight where relevant

## 🎯 Top 6 Current Priorities

### Priority 1: Build Out Local Clinics Section
**Status:** 🟡 Longevity Complete, 3 Categories Remaining
**Sprint:** Next

**Current State:**
- DEXA Scans: 2 providers listed (BodySpec, DexaFit) but minimal detail
- VO2 Max: 0 providers
- IV Therapy: 0 providers
- Longevity Clinics: ✅ COMPLETE - Hub + 4 regional pages + 7 international guides

**What Needs to Be Done:**
1. **Research & add providers for each category:**
   - DEXA: Expand BodySpec/DexaFit profiles, add 3-5 more regional options
   - VO2 Max: Research top 5 providers (PNOE, VO2 Master, clinic chains)
   - IV Therapy: Research national chains (IV Bars, Drip Hydration, local options)
   - Longevity: Research clinics (Fountain Life, Human Longevity, Function Health clinics)

2. **Create rich provider profiles with:**
   - Service offerings & pricing
   - Locations/coverage areas
   - What to expect during visit
   - Pros/cons
   - Who it's best for

3. **Build category landing pages similar to telehealth:**
   - Comparison tables
   - "Best for" recommendations
   - Educational content about each service

**Why Important:**
- Huge gap in current offering (4 empty categories)
- Local search intent = high conversion potential
- Competitive advantage (few comprehensive local clinic directories exist)
- Revenue opportunity via lead gen/affiliate

**ETA:** 1-2 weeks for full buildout
